Awesome list of uBlacklist subscriptions to block search results from google, bing & duckduckgo.

## Background: What is uBlacklist?
uBlacklist is a browser extension which prevents blacklisted sites from appearing in Google, Bing or DDG search results.

Get the extension here:

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe) / [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/) (made by [iorate](https://github.com/iorate) Twitter: [@iorate](https://twitter.com/iorate))

uBlacklist Repo: https://github.com/iorate/uBlacklist

## How to use it: Blocking rules
You can add rules to uBlacklist to block specific pages or domains from appearing on the search results page.  These rules can be specified with wildcard pattern matching or regular expressions.

Wildcard pattern matching: `*://*.example.com/*`

Regular expressions: `/example\.(net|org)/`

## Use subscriptions 

Rather than start your own blacklist from scratch, you can subscribe to pre-existing blacklists (built by the community).

A subscription file is simply a UTF-8 encoded text file.  Here is an example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iorate/ublacklist-example-subscription/master/uBlacklist.txt

They can be hosted anywhere, including github (**Just ensure you copy the raw link version into the extension.**)
